# Store-wise Brand Analysis

This project involves analyzing store-wise data to understand trends, replenishment rates, consumption rates, and average shelf fullness for different brands. The analysis is carried out using Python and various libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and xlwings.

# Project Overview

The main objectives of this analytics project are:

1. **Data Extraction**: The project starts by extracting data from an Excel file located in the specified directory using the pandas library.

2. **Average Fullness Calculation**: The `avg_fullness` function calculates the average fullness for a given date and brand. It iterates through the data to calculate the average fullness based on the provided date and brand name.

3. **Critical Points Identification**: The `critical_pts` function identifies critical points in the data. It processes the data to determine significant changes in fullness that indicate potential replenishment or consumption events.

4. **Data Visualization**: The project includes data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn libraries. Various charts and graphs are generated to visualize trends, critical points, and rates of replenishment and consumption.

5. **Excel Report Generation**: The analysis results are presented in an Excel report. Dataframes containing MTTR, MTTC, replenishment rate, consumption rate, and average shelf fullness are created and saved in an Excel file.




# Results and Conclusion

This analytics project provides insights into the trends, replenishment rates, consumption rates, and average shelf fullness for different brands in different stores. By analyzing critical points, the project helps in understanding when and how replenishment and consumption events occur. The visualizations provide a clear representation of the data patterns and trends.<br>
